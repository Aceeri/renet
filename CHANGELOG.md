# Renet changelog

## Unreleased
### Added ‚≠ê
* Rechannel: added max_message_size configuration for channels. This fixes an exploit over the block channel,
it was possible to send a SliceMessage with a high value of num_slices, this would cause the channel to allocate a lot of memory causing out of memories errors. [(commit)](https://github.com/lucaspoffo/renet/commit/774d0eeb1d05356edc29a368561e735b0eb8ab9f)
* Rechannel: add fuzzing testing for processing packets [(commit)](https://github.com/lucaspoffo/renet/commit/5d273a561ece040865fb8800177b4a213e61b868)
* Rechannel: split channels into Sender and Receiver [(commit)](https://github.com/lucaspoffo/renet/commit/e76fb907052bbb51368d7630cdd6cb6e4a6c1df8)
